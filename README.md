Here are all the projects we worked on.

There are two scripts in this project to make it easier to run

- `npm run start-server`
- `npm run start-client`

In VSCode, press `Ctrl`+`Shift`+\` to open the terminal and then
press `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`5` in order to split the terminal.
Now you can run both scripts together.
